# IEEE-802.11n-CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit
* This repository is part of an early-stage WiFi and camera data fusion-based human detection and motion estimation project.
* The goal of our research is to develop a multimodal-based computer vision technology to detect and track objects beyond walls by adding IEEE 802.11 standard WiFi signals.
* A multimodal approach that additionally utilizes WiFi signals can complement problems such as obstacles and object obscuration that occur in existing camera-based security and computer vision through the radio frequency (RF) signal characteristics.
* I hope that this approach and research will be further activated as a practical way to prevent crime in areas where CCTV deployment is restricted to protect personal information.

This repository's purpose is to support building the CSI-enabled **TP-Link AC1750** Wi-Fi drivers for **Intel 5300 NIC** adapters on Linux distributions with **Unbuntu 14.01** versions. At this point, this code has been tested on Ubuntu **14.01**, **16.04**, and **18.04**.

The code presented here comprises a modified and merged version of the Linux kernel, such as the firmware command, and error lines of the original baseline. The modifications were made by examining the code provided by [dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool](https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool) and adapting them to more recent Linux kernel versions **- iwlwifi** and **wlp1s0** modules. The building and installation instructions were taken from [the original Linux 802.11n CSI Tool website](https://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/) and adapted accordingly. Moreover, I referred to the synchronization method between CSI and Camera from [CSI-Tool-Camera-Shooting](https://github.com/qiyinghua/CSI-Tool-Camera-Shooting).

Additionally, initial toolkit issues have been discussed among mobility detection researchers using WiFi signals and Channel State Information (CSI). To this end, we provide a calculation function **newly_csi_analyzer.m** of amplitude and phase, and signal processing from the acquired CSI samples. Herein, I referred to novel approaches [DensePose From WiFi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250) and [Can WiFi Estimate Person Pose?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00277).

# 1. Installation instructions of integrated CSI toolkit
## (1). Kernel version:
Before proceeding further, you need to check the version of your kernel. It should be **4.15**, otherwise, the commands below won't work. The following command will print that information:
```ruby
uname -r
```

## (2). First download the essential packages:
```ruby
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) git-core
```
```ruby![159](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO/IEEE-802.11n-CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit/assets/96539912/d66d3979-6ddf-4259-a843-ba61901eedcc)

```

## (7). Unzip OpenCV to utilize the USB camera:
```ruby
cd CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit/camera_tool
```
```ruby
unzip opencv-2.4.13.6.zip
```
```ruby
cd opencv-2.4.13.6/install

cmake ..
```
```ruby
make
```
```ruby

sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf
```
Then add the /usr/local/lib command to the file.
```ruby
sudo ldconfig
```
```ruby
sudo gedit /etc/bash.bashrc
```
Then add the following command to the end of the file:
```ruby
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

# 2. Guideline Operation of integrated CSI toolkit
## (1). setting of the WiFi router and wireless LAN card:
The below comments (1) only need to be performed once after turning on the computer.
```ruby
iw dev wlp1s0 link
```
```ruby
sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi mac80211
```
```ruby
sudo modprobe iwlwifi connector_log=0x1
```
The below comment returns the MAC address, such as XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
```ruby
sudo ls /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/netdev:wlp1s0/stations/
```
Check the supported modulation, and transmission rate table from the connected WiFi
```ruby
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/netdev:wlp1s0/stations/XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX/rate_scale_table
```
Set the transmit rate from the checked table. In our case, we set it as 0x4007 (16-QAM, 1/2).
```ruby
echo 0x4007 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/netdev:wlp1s0/stations/XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX/rate_scale_table
```
```ruby
echo 0x4007 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/iwlwifi/iwldvm/debug/bcast_tx_rate
```
```ruby
echo 0x4007 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/iwlwifi/iwldvm/debug/monitor_tx_rate
```

## (2). Starting this toolkit program (utilized three kernel terminals):
```ruby
sudo dhclient wlp1s0
```
comment under kernel terminal, 

where the camera parameters constructed [*Camera ID*] [*Save Interval*] [*Auto Exit*]

[*Camera ID*]: This parameter controls which camera to use when the computer has multiple cameras. When set to 0, the program will use the first camera. When set to 1, the program will use the second camera.

[*Save Interval*]: This parameter controls the speed at which images are saved. When set to 0, the program will save each frame of the camera. When set to 1, the program will save an image every other frame.

[*Auto Exit*]: This parameter controls whether the program automatically exits when CSI collects stops. When set to 0, This program will always run. When set to 1, This program will automatically exit when no CSI is acquired within 1 second.

Open the first Linux kernel and write the below command:
```ruby
cd CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit/supplementary/netlink/camera 0 1 0
```
Open the second Linux kernel to execute 'log_to_file':
```ruby
cd CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit/supplementary/netlink/log_to_file test.dat
```
Open another kernel terminal, where ping testing is a way to encourage the collection of more CSI samples:
```ruby
ping 192.xxx.xx.xx -i 0.3
```

# WiFi signals and human posture correlation
- The experimental results demonstrate that WiFi signal characteristics vary according to human postures. Specifically, the difference in phase values between standing and sitting postures is more pronounced. This suggests that the distinct signal features can be employed for accurately training multimodal deep learning models for object detection, tracking, and pose estimation without solely relying on vision information.
